*** CaT workflows with EDM ***

0 - Refactor base datastructures

-- exercise info / data
-- global state? global features?
-- re-think datastructure/class for computing/storing feature data + feature list curvature (location dd), speed, (acceleration/deceleration = speed d, speed dd?, slope = location d)?
-- allow alignment by other param than location(x,y)? (e.g. exercise about pressure where location does not matter), allow multiple variable alignment with weights?
-- student practice: compute feature values in real time? (fast forumla / less granular or less accurate to gain speed?, how to do real-time alignment?, compare with custom version of EDM?)
-- edm creation + student report: compute feature values in post processing (better alignment, process all features values )

1 - Expert create exercise

fill in exercise info
-- {name, strictness, description, features, feature weights?}
make target-trace
-- x,y and number of datapoints used for aligning all trace-over attempts to
make demonstration data
-- several trace-over (pre-set to 5 for dev):
--- align(x,y) each to target-trace, interpolate/merge datapoints to have a trace-over-aligned
--- compute feature values for each trace-over-aligned datapoint
--- update the EDM with the trace-over-aligned-featurevalues (std, mean per feature)
save the exercise


2 - Student report: compare student trace(s) with EDMdata

-- compare several student traces, one at a time with the EDMdata (to have scores for each attempt, which can later be aggregated, also important to be able to score a single attempt so that student can see score after each attempt during a multiple-repetition-practicesession)
--- for each student trace:
---- compare each datapoint with the edm, store the comparison result in a exercise-result datasctucture
!!! think of the results that will be displayed, to make sure the datastructure is well chosen for the exercise-result
